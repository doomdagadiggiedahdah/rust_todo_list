## motivation and kudos
I'd be lost without text and so this project won't start (or at least finish) without a 
thought dump, my old friend.

Motivation behind this whole project was from a challenge from a friend of mine, Zach Birenbaum 
for me to see how hard Rust actually is. I'm ready for the challenge.

Further motivation for the implementation comes from my friend Thor, who ran an experiment testing
whether prototyping a program in Python before writing in Rust would save one time, and yes, it did.
Since it worked for him, a professional Rust dev, I imagine it couldn't hurt for me.
(See experiment here: https://thork.net/posts/20211015_how_effective_prototyping_euler50/)

What follows, may not have any use to you. You are warned. This will consist of me writing down
mostly when my confusions arise and walk through what's going through my head in order to get though it.
I'd love to know if this is useful, and if so, message me on github.
